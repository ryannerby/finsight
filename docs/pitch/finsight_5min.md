# Finsight: AI-Powered Financial Due Diligence
## Transform months of analysis into minutes with AI

## Why The Problem

**Speaker Notes:** 
*[Hook: Start with a story]* Imagine you're trying to buy a small business. You're excited about the opportunity, but then reality hits - you need to understand the financial health of this company. 

*[What: Current pain]* Right now, financial due diligence is like trying to solve a giant puzzle in the dark. Analysts spend 8-20 hours poring over spreadsheets, looking for red flags, and trying to make sense of numbers that don't always add up.

*[So What: Why it matters]* This isn't just about time - it's about money and risk. When you hire external consultants, you're looking at $5,000 to $15,000 per analysis. But the real cost is what happens when you miss something important. Critical issues often surface after you've already signed a letter of intent, wasting months of work and thousands of dollars.

*[Now What: Connect to audience]* Think about the last time you had to make a big decision with incomplete information. That feeling of uncertainty, that fear of missing something important - that's what we're solving.

*[Transition]* So what if there was a better way?

## The Solution

**Speaker Notes:** 
*[Hook: Transformation story]* What if I told you that instead of weeks of analysis, you could get the same insights in under 2 minutes? That's exactly what Finsight delivers.

*[What: What we do]* We've built an AI platform that works like having a team of expert financial analysts working around the clock. You simply upload your financial documents - PDFs, Excel files, or CSV data - and our system goes to work immediately.

*[So What: Why this matters]* Here's the magic: we don't just calculate numbers. We understand them. Our AI identifies patterns that humans might miss, spots red flags before they become problems, and gives you a clear picture of what you're really buying.

*[Examples and benefits]* Instead of spending hours calculating ratios, you get 15+ key metrics instantly. Instead of wondering if you missed something, you get a traffic light system that shows you exactly where to focus. And instead of static reports, you can ask questions and get answers in real-time.

*[Transition]* But how does this actually work? Let me show you the technology behind the magic.

## The Tech Stack (How)

**Speaker Notes:** 
*[Hook: Build confidence]* I know what you're thinking - "This sounds too good to be true." Let me show you why it's not just possible, but reliable.

*[What: Our technology choices]* We've built Finsight using the same technologies that power some of the world's most trusted applications. Our frontend uses React and TypeScript - think of it like building with LEGO blocks that always fit together perfectly. Our backend runs on Node.js and Express, which means it's fast and can handle multiple users at once.

*[So What: Why these choices matter]* Here's why this matters for you: we chose Supabase for our database because it's built on PostgreSQL - the same database that banks and financial institutions trust with their most sensitive data. When we say your financial information is secure, we mean it.

*[AI explanation]* For the AI magic, we use Claude API. Think of Claude like having a financial expert who never sleeps, never gets tired, and never makes calculation errors. But here's the key: we don't just trust Claude with the math. We do the calculations ourselves to ensure accuracy, then use Claude to explain what those numbers mean in plain English.

*[Reliability focus]* We've built in safeguards at every level. Rate limiting means our system handles busy times gracefully. Error handling means you get results even when things go wrong. And our timeout management ensures you never wait more than 90 seconds for an analysis.

*[Transition]* Now let me walk you through what this looks like in practice.

## Core Flow / Demo

**Speaker Notes:** 
*[Hook: Customer journey]* Let me tell you the story of Sarah, a small business investor who used Finsight last week. Sarah was looking at a manufacturing company and had three years of financial statements to review.

*[What: The process]* Here's what happened: Sarah dragged her files into our system. Our AI immediately recognized these were P&L statements, balance sheets, and cash flow data. Within 30 seconds, we had extracted all the key numbers and started our analysis.

*[So What: The transformation]* In under 2 minutes, Sarah had something that would normally take her team days to create: a complete financial health score, red flag alerts, and key ratios that showed this company was actually much healthier than it appeared on the surface.

*[Customer story continued]* But here's where it got interesting. Sarah could ask questions like "What's driving the seasonal revenue patterns?" and get instant answers based on the actual data. She could export a professional report to share with her partners. And she could save everything for future reference.

*[Now What: The result]* Sarah went from "maybe this is a good deal" to "this is definitely worth pursuing" in under 10 minutes. She saved herself weeks of analysis and thousands of dollars in consulting fees.

*[Transition]* Building something like this taught us some valuable lessons about what works and what doesn't.

## Lessons Learned

**Speaker Notes:** 
*[Hook: Behind the scenes]* Building Finsight has been like building a race car while racing it. We've learned some hard lessons, but they've made our product much stronger.

*[What: Key insights]* Our first lesson came from trying to use AI for everything. We quickly learned that AI is amazing at explaining things and spotting patterns, but when it comes to financial calculations, you need to do the math yourself. Think of it like this: you wouldn't ask a friend to calculate your mortgage payment - you'd use a calculator. We built our own calculator for financial ratios.

*[So What: Why this matters]* This approach gives us the best of both worlds. Our calculations are always accurate because we control the math. Our explanations are always clear because Claude can focus on what it does best - making complex financial concepts easy to understand.

*[More lessons]* We also learned that the Claude API has limits, just like any service. So we built a smart queuing system that handles busy times gracefully. When lots of people are using Finsight, our system automatically manages the load so everyone gets their results quickly.

*[Business wisdom]* The biggest lesson? Financial data comes in many different formats, and each company organizes their books differently. We built a system that can handle this chaos and turn it into clean, comparable data. It's like having a universal translator for financial statements.

*[Transition]* So where do we go from here? Let me show you what's next.

## What's Next?

**Speaker Notes:** 
*[Hook: Future vision]* I want you to imagine a world where financial due diligence is as simple as checking your email. That's where we're headed.

*[What: Our roadmap]* We're currently building an interactive Q&A interface that will let you ask questions about any business in natural language. Instead of digging through reports, you'll be able to ask "What's the biggest risk in this deal?" and get a clear, data-backed answer.

*[So What: Why this matters]* We're also implementing what we call RAG - retrieval-augmented generation. This is a fancy way of saying we're teaching our AI to find the most relevant information in your documents and give you answers that are grounded in your actual data, not generic responses.

*[Advanced features]* Looking further ahead, we're building peer benchmarking. Imagine being able to see how the company you're evaluating compares to others in the same industry. We're also working on scenario modeling - what happens to this business if interest rates go up? If the economy slows down?

*[Mobile experience]* And yes, we're making everything mobile-friendly. Because the best deals often happen when you're not at your desk.

*[Now What: Call to action]* Our goal is simple: make financial due diligence so easy and reliable that it becomes a standard part of every business evaluation. We want to turn what used to be a barrier into a competitive advantage.

*[Closing]* Finsight isn't just about saving time and money. It's about making better decisions with confidence. Because when you can see the full picture clearly, you can move faster, negotiate better, and close more deals.

Thank you for your time. I'm excited to show you how Finsight can transform your due diligence process.
